    "Our population parameter $\\theta$ is just the overall probability that people respond correctly when asked to guess which side of the card is displayed in the ESP study. Our test statistic $X$ is the *count* of the number of people who did so, out of a sample size of $N$.  This is exactly what the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) describes! So, we would say that the null hypothesis predicts that $X$ is binomially distributed, which is written\n",

    "Your goal here is to compute the critical region for $\\alpha = .05$ (the type-I error rate) using sampling. Thus, you should randomly generate 10,000 experiments, each with $N=100$ coin flips, and record the test statistic $X$ for each simulated experiment. Your goal is to find the lower and upper \"critical values\" given your sampling distribution (See figure below for a visualization. Your simulations should roughly match this plot).\n",
