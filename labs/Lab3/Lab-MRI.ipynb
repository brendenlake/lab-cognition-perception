Pay particular attention to the spatial distribution of the voxels in the thresholded map. What do you notice about the spatial arrangement of the voxels who have the most significant correlation with the predictor timecourse? Where are those voxels compared to each other? What about the voxels that are significant at p < .29? Do you notice anything funny about where some of these voxels are relative to the underlying gray brain image?\n",

If we observe a correlation that has a significance value of p < .05 we would reject the null hypothesis that the two sets of values are unrelated with the caveat that we might be wrong up to 5% of the time.\n",
