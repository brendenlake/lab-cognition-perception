# # Lab 4: Reinforcement Learning

# This chapter by Todd M. Gureckis and Hillary Raab.

# Read [this](GureckisLove_RL_chapter.pdf) introductory chapter about the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning.  There are a few equations here but do not get too hung up on them during your first approach to the material.  Just keep pushing through and return to the equations later if you have difficulty with them.  In many cases the subsequent material makes things more clear~
